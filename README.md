# The Insight Edit: Recession Series

This project explores how fashion and consumer behavior signal economic downturns — using data to uncover subtle patterns in how people adapt emotionally and practically during recessionary periods. 

## What’s This About?
Are lipstick sales, loungewear trends, or resale market spikes early indicators of economic stress? This series uses real-world data to find out.

## Focus Areas:
- The Lipstick Index: Do small luxuries rise during downturns?
- Thrifting & Budget Fashion: Signs of financial restraint or style shift?
- Dopamine Dressing: Can mood be measured through color?
- Outlet Shopping & Dupes: Consumer creativity in tough times

## Tools Used:
- Google Trends
- Python + Colab
- Tableau & Canva
- Reddit/TikTok sentiment (optional)
- Public resale reports (e.g., ThredUp)

## Structure:
- `/data/` – Google Trends CSVs, cleaned datasets
- `/notebooks/` – Jupyter/Colab notebooks for analysis
- `/visuals/` – Charts and infographics
- `/shorts/` – Scripts and assets for YouTube/Instagram content
- `/reports/` – Written analysis and summary findings

## Goal:
This project is part of The Insight Edit — a self-directed analytics series focused on uncovering human-centered trends through data storytelling.
